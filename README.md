# Primrose Illusion
Create a mind-boggling illusion by running CircleIllusion.py

This program draws a grid of green squares and small pink primroses 
in such a way that tricks your mind into seeing movement on a flat image.

IllusionHelper.py is a supplemental file containing basic shapes in methods 
that are utilized in these illusions for the turtle to quickly draw.
In this program, drawSquare and DrawDiamond are used from the helper file.
